This is kind of continuation of Methods of Programming. But better written. It still has been sent on BaCa and I needed to do this in one file only, but fortunately there wasn't so much conditions with implementation so at least I could finally use built-in functions.

As in Methods of Programming each exercise is focused on some algorithm:  
Exercise A: Dijkstra's algorithm  
Exercise B: permutations of BST  
Exercise C: studying graphs  
Exercise D: optimal BST  
Exercise E: bitonic tour

Contents of these tasks are available only in Polish.
